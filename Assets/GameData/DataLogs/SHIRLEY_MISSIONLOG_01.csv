ENTRY 01 DATE|15:18|Flight going well.|We’ve lifted off from Cape Caneveral and are on the way to Mars. This will be a crazy experience… I can’t imagine what we’ll find out there. Mission Control says we shouldn’t talk about confidential stuff in these messages, but I just can help it. The reports from the Paegen Satellite are stunning. 
ENTRY 02 DATE|08:19|The flight ahead|The crew is doing well. It’s going to be a long flight though and I can already feel cabin fever kicking in. This is something we planned for though, so hopefully the entertainment MC provided is enough to hold us over.
ENTRY 03 DATE|10:49|Bickering :(|Kenneth and Lillie got into a little fight last night. Nothing major, but I’m hoping it’s not a sign for the future of the mission. If it is, I’m in for a long three years…
