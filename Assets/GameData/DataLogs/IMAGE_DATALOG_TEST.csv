02/01/85|15:18|First martian image||Our first ever image on the surface of Mars! I can hardly believe I’m actually here
02/10/85|08:19|Homesickness|I didn’t think I would actually get homesick, but here I am. It’s really hard to come to terms with the fact I’ll never return to Earth.|
02/24/85|10:49|Me and Hoskins||Hoskins has been getting into photography and setup the tripod while we were relaxing one afternoon. I can’t wait to see what other stuff she comes up with.
03/31/85|12:14|A baby|Hoskins is pregnant and it’s my baby. I suppose something like this was to be expected, but what did MC expect. That we would be content with looking at each other for years and never touching or getting close. What an absurd thought!&&In other new, we found the metallic structure that were seen from space. Looks super interesting and I’m looking forward to getting a closer look. This could be the proof of life we’ve always wanted!!|
